Welcome to the ShepTokenizer!

The list of files that are REQUIRED for ShepTokenizer to operate properly are: 
    ShepTokenizer.java - Contains the Tokenizer implementation.
    ShepToken.java - A supplementary class that's used for the underlying implementation of the Tokenizer.
    reservedKeywords.txt - Basically contains every special word or symbol that CORE programs care about. Needed for the token logic.

    from Microsoft (https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win) in order to compile and execute Java on an OSU CSE computer.
